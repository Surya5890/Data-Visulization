# Data-Visulization
My Own Data Visulization Tool(which is created as a plugin for Ticketing Tools that can provide statistical view and better insights)

As part of my Data Science career, I wanted to create my own web plugin that can connect with a SQL(PostgreSQL/Oracle) Databases and create visualization functions. This particular apploication will have the capabilities to compare two different team's productivity and efficiency and can do the same for two different team members. We can also analyse a team member's past and present efficiency and productvity..
Key functions are as below:
  1. Compare Achievements
  2. Self-Achievement Compare
  3. Repeated Ticket Analysis
  4. Case Type Analysis
  5. SLA Breach Analysis
  6. On-Hold Analysis
  7. Outage Analysis
  8. Idle Analysis

I have used StreamLit framework.
